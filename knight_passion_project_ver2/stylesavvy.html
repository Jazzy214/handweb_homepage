                Style Savvy Trendsetters is a game that I used to play a lot when I was younger. It is a 2ds game and I think that this was the latest release in the series. The goal is to run your own boutique and become one of the best designers haha but you could do many more things as well!

                I count this game as one of my favorite cozy games still because of the nostalgia. I can remember making over customers and going to the cafe during the fall season. It was always so cozy!
