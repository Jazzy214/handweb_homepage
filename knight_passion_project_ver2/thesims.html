                The Sims is a game that Iâ€™m sure many people have heard of. Although the game can be pretty chaotic at times, I think that it is probably one of the first games that I go to if I want to relax and unwind after a long day. I spend most of my time playing in CAS (the character creation) making sims. I can zone out for hours just doing that!

                Outside of the character creation, you can bring the sims that you make to life and watch as the world changes around them. No two sim stories have to be the same, so it is always a fun time.
