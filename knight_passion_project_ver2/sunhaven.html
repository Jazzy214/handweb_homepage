                Sun Haven is a relatively new game. The game developers are still updating and adding new features and the game is only getting better! I started playing while it was still in early access and even back then it quickly became one of my favorite games.

            I think that one of the major reasons this game is so cozy is the art style and soundtrack. The game itself is so beautiful and with the new addition of seasons, I find myself just sitting somewhere in-game for periods of time admiring the ambiance.
