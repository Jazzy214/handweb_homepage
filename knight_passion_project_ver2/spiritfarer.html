            As described, your goal in Spiritfarer is to travel the world helping spirits move on to the afterlife. As the main character and ferry master, Stella, you run a boat and travel from island to island looking for people to help. You decorate your boat, fish, take on little quests, and most importantly, guide your passengers to their final resting place.
