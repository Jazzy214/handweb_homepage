            <a href="https://www.stardewvalleywiki.com/Stardew_Valley_Wiki" class="link">Stardew Valley</a> is one of the most famous cozy games, and I think it might have been my first introduction to this category of gaming. Stardew Valley is an indie RPG simulation game that was created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Barone_(developer)" class="link">CocnernedApe</a> in 2016.

            In this game, you are brought back to an empty farm left to you by your grandpa. The farm is located in a small town called Pelican Town. You are this town's new farmer and, as such, you are responsible for planting crops, harvesting them each season, raising animals, and becoming friends with the locals. Stardew is a very relaxing game that can be enjoyed by anyone.
