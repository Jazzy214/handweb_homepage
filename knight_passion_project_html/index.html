            <b class="subhead">What is a “cozy” game?</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            My personal definition of a “cozy” game is a game that is casual, relaxing, and an overall healing experience for the person playing it. A cozy game can come in many forms, there is no one blueprint that qualifies a game as being cozy. If you can come home after a long day of work, snuggle up in your favorite blanket, put on a game, and find peace and comfort while playing it, then I would consider it a cozy game!
            <br>
            Many “cozy” games can often be characterized by their softer aesthetic and more laid-back gameplay. From my experience, a lot of these games include a few of these things: farming, decorating, cooking, relationship building, dress-up, and fishing. Although, some have none of these things. A cozy game can span from a game like unpacking where you help your character move their belongings, to a game like Disney Dreamlight Valley where you help build and populate an entire town.
